# Valentine Front-End Gift

This is a simple, front-end-only Valentine-themed website you can open locally. It includes a romantic hero, a love message, a photo gallery (with lightbox), videos, a timeline of memories, and optional background music.

How to use
- Place these files in a folder and open `index.html` in a browser.
- Replace placeholder images and videos with your personal photos and clips. Update the `src` or `data-src` attributes in `index.html`.
- To include your own background music, replace the `source` in the `audio#bg-music` element or remove it.

Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling and responsive layout
- `script.js` — interactions: lightbox, lazy load, music, reveal

Customization tips
- Edit the messages in the `message` and `final` sections to personalize the text.
- Use higher-quality photos for the gallery. Unsplash links are used as placeholders.
- For a private preview, open `index.html` directly or serve via a local static server (optional).

Enjoy — and happy Valentine’s Day!
